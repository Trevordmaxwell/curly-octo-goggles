# Unified Mamba-Hopfield-DEQ: Theoretical Foundation

## Overview

This architecture unifies three powerful paradigms into a single coherent framework where memory retrieval, sequence processing, and iterative reasoning emerge from a common optimization objective.

## Mathematical Framework

### 1. Energy Function

The system minimizes a unified energy function:

```
E(z, x, M) = E_Hopfield(z, M) + E_consistency(z, x) + E_reg(z)
```

Where:
- `E_Hopfield(z, M) = -log(Σᵢ exp(β⟨z, mᵢ⟩))`: Modern Hopfield energy for pattern retrieval
- `E_consistency(z, x) = ||z - f_mamba(z, x)||²`: DEQ fixed-point residual
- `E_reg(z) = λ||z||²`: Regularization for bounded solutions

### 2. Unified Dynamics

The dynamics function combines temporal processing (Mamba) and associative retrieval (Hopfield):

```
z_{t+1} = f(z_t, x, M) = g(Mamba(z_t, x), Hopfield(z_t, M))
```

Where `g` is a learned gating function that adaptively blends both contributions.

### 3. Equilibrium Conditions

Convergence occurs when both conditions are satisfied:
1. **Fixed-point**: `z* = f(z*, x, M)`
2. **Energy minimum**: `∇E(z*) = 0`

## Convergence Guarantees

### Theorem 1: Existence of Equilibria

If the dynamics `f` are contractive (Lipschitz constant L < 1) and the energy function is bounded below, then equilibria exist.

**Proof sketch**: Banach fixed-point theorem + energy minimization principles.

### Theorem 2: Lyapunov Stability

The energy function E serves as a Lyapunov function, guaranteeing stable convergence.

**Proof**: E decreases monotonically along trajectories: `E(z_{t+1}) ≤ E(z_t)` for all t.

### Theorem 3: Compositional Memory

The Hopfield component enables compositional operations: binding, unbinding, and superposition of patterns with graceful degradation.

## Computational Complexity

- **Forward pass**: O(L·D²) where L = sequence length, D = model dimension
  - Mamba: O(L·D) per layer (linear in sequence length)
  - Hopfield: O(M·D) where M = number of memory patterns
  - DEQ: O(K·L·D²) where K = convergence iterations
- **Backward pass**: O(D³) for implicit differentiation
  - Uses conjugate gradient to avoid explicit Jacobian
  - Memory: O(D²) instead of O(K·D²)
- **Memory storage**: O(M·D) for patterns, independent of sequence length

## Key Innovations

1. **Unified optimization**: Single equilibrium satisfies both temporal consistency and memory retrieval
2. **Implicit depth**: DEQ wrapper provides unbounded reasoning depth with constant memory
3. **Compositional memory**: Hopfield enables structured knowledge representation
4. **Theoretical guarantees**: Provable convergence under mild conditions
