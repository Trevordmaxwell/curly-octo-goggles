"""Unified energy-based learning framework.

This package will provide a cohesive implementation that merges:
- Mamba-style temporal state-space processing,
- Modern Hopfield Network associative memory,
- Deep Equilibrium Model reasoning, and
- Energy-based learning principles.

The implementation proceeds in structured phases to ensure theoretical and
empirical rigor.
